# Enterprise Security & Compliance Framework

## üîí Zero-Trust Security Architecture

### Current Security Gap Analysis
```yaml
Current State (85-point limitations):
  Authentication: Firebase Auth (basic)
  Authorization: Simple role-based
  Data Encryption: TLS in-transit only
  Compliance: Basic GDPR considerations
  Monitoring: Firebase console only

Target State (120+ point enterprise):
  Authentication: Multi-factor + SSO + Hardware keys
  Authorization: Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
  Data Encryption: End-to-end + field-level + key rotation
  Compliance: SOC2 Type II + ISO27001 + GDPR + CCPA + HIPAA-ready
  Monitoring: Real-time threat detection + automated response
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Multi-Layer Security Implementation

### 1. Identity & Access Management (IAM)

#### Advanced Authentication Stack
```typescript
interface EnterpriseAuthConfig {
  multiFactorAuth: {
    hardwareKeys: ["YubiKey", "Google Titan", "Solo Keys"],
    biometrics: ["TouchID", "FaceID", "Windows Hello"],
    smsBackup: "Time-based OTP fallback",
    recoveryMethods: ["Admin override", "Hardware backup key"]
  };
  
  singleSignOn: {
    protocols: ["SAML 2.0", "OpenID Connect", "OAuth 2.1"],
    providers: ["Okta", "Azure AD", "Google Workspace", "AWS SSO"],
    justInTimeProvisioning: true,
    attributeMapping: "Dynamic role assignment"
  };
  
  sessionManagement: {
    sessionTimeout: "Configurable (15min-8hours)",
    concurrentSessions: "Per-plan limits",
    deviceTrust: "Device fingerprinting + certificate binding",
    locationAwareness: "Geo-based access restrictions"
  };
}
```

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Evolution
```python
class EnterpriseRBAC:
    def __init__(self):
        self.roles = {
            "super_admin": {
                "permissions": ["*"],
                "mfa_required": True,
                "ip_restrictions": True,
                "audit_trail": "All actions logged"
            },
            "organization_admin": {
                "permissions": ["manage_users", "view_all_data", "configure_settings"],
                "scope": "organization",
                "delegation": "Can create sub-admins"
            },
            "team_manager": {
                "permissions": ["manage_team_accounts", "view_team_analytics"],
                "scope": "team",
                "approval_workflows": "Required for sensitive operations"
            },
            "content_creator": {
                "permissions": ["create_posts", "schedule_posts", "view_own_analytics"],
                "scope": "assigned_accounts",
                "content_approval": "Manager approval for high-risk content"
            },
            "viewer": {
                "permissions": ["view_analytics", "export_reports"],
                "scope": "read_only",
                "data_masking": "PII automatically hidden"
            }
        }
    
    def implement_abac(self):
        """Attribute-Based Access Control for fine-grained permissions"""
        return {
            "subject_attributes": ["role", "department", "clearance_level", "location"],
            "resource_attributes": ["classification", "owner", "sensitivity_level"],
            "environment_attributes": ["time", "location", "device_trust_level"],
            "action_attributes": ["operation_type", "risk_level", "approval_required"]
        }
```

### 2. Data Protection & Privacy

#### Field-Level Encryption
```typescript
class AdvancedDataProtection {
  private readonly keyManagement: CloudKMS;
  private readonly encryptionKeys: Map<string, EncryptionKey>;
  
  async encryptSensitiveFields(data: any): Promise<EncryptedData> {
    const sensitiveFields = [
      'accessTokens',
      'userEmails', 
      'personalData',
      'paymentInformation',
      'proxyCredentials'
    ];
    
    return Promise.all(
      sensitiveFields.map(async field => {
        if (data[field]) {
          const encryptedValue = await this.keyManagement.encrypt(
            data[field], 
            this.getFieldSpecificKey(field)
          );
          return { [field]: encryptedValue };
        }
      })
    );
  }
  
  async implementDataMasking(userData: UserData, requesterRole: Role): Promise<MaskedData> {
    const maskingRules = {
      'viewer': ['email', 'phone', 'address'],
      'content_creator': ['payment_info', 'admin_fields'],
      'team_manager': ['super_admin_fields']
    };
    
    return this.applyMaskingRules(userData, maskingRules[requesterRole]);
  }
}
```

#### Privacy-First Data Architecture
```python
class PrivacyByDesign:
    def __init__(self):
        self.privacy_principles = [
            "data_minimization",      # Collect only necessary data
            "purpose_limitation",     # Use data only for stated purpose
            "storage_limitation",     # Automatic data retention policies
            "user_control",          # User can modify/delete their data
            "transparency",          # Clear data usage explanations
            "security_safeguards",   # Default encryption and protection
            "accountability"         # Audit trails and compliance reporting
        ]
    
    def implement_data_governance(self):
        return {
            "automatic_retention": {
                "user_activity_logs": "90 days",
                "post_content": "User-controlled",
                "analytics_data": "2 years aggregated only",
                "audit_logs": "7 years (compliance requirement)"
            },
            "user_rights_automation": {
                "data_export": "Automated within 24 hours",
                "data_deletion": "Right to be forgotten in 30 days",
                "consent_management": "Granular opt-in/opt-out",
                "data_portability": "Standard format exports"
            }
        }
```

    def real_time_threat_analysis(self, event_stream):
        """Real-time security event analysis with ML"""
        threats = []
        
        for event in event_stream:
            risk_score = self.calculate_risk_score(event)
            
            if risk_score > self.get_threshold("critical"):
                threats.append({
                    "severity": "critical",
